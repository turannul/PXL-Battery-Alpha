// to-do: code 
// Idea here prepare a view to be shown to the user when the prefs is opened for the first time (Question is how to know if the prefs is opened for the first time?)
// This view will be shown only once and then the user will be able to dismiss it (add a key file user UserGreeted = 0 or 1)
// if UserGreeted = 0 then show the view and set UserGreeted = 1
// if UserGreeted = 1 then do nothing
// Later if version updated set UserGreeted = 0 and show the view again
